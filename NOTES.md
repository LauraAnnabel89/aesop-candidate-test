## 1. Research & Development

Did you search for something specific online? If so, detail below the resources used:

- https://css-tricks.com/scaling-responsive-animations/
- https://joshbroton.com/quick-fix-sass-mixins-for-css-keyframe-animations/
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/
- https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/


Did you resolve the exercise without looking at anything online? Was that because you done something similar in the past?

The building of the actual animation was quick and I didn't need any resources as it's something I've done a few times, especially in my spare time!

## 2. Personal Considerations

It's been a little while since I did any animations with React, so I tried to simplify it as much as possible. I did consider looking at setting a timeout on component did mount but it didn't seem necessary in this case, as the event itself is the window loading.

## 3. Review and Optimisation

Spent some further consideration looking at how to make this animation accessible, the colour contrast is 17.95:1, which is great, I would limit the amount of times the animation ran and limit the size of it to less of the viewport.
